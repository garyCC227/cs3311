# COMP3311 12s1 Exam Q11

(a)
A->BC, DE->F, ADE->G

(b)
  ABCDEFG
  key = ADE
  (1) use: A->BC
      table(1): ABC, fds ={A->BC}
      table(2): ADEFG, fds = {DE->F, ADE->G}

  (2) by table(2), use : DE->F
  table(3): DEF, fds = {DE->F}
  table(4): ADEG, fds = {ADE->G}

  conclusion: for BCNF schema
    table(1): ABC, fds ={A->BC}
    table(3): DEF, fds = {DE->F}
    table(4): ADEG, fds = {ADE->G}

(c)
  BCNF:
    1. those tables eliminates all redundancy and recomposite back to 
      original table will not lost any infomation
    2. but it will not keep all the original functional dependencies

  3NF:
    1. eliminates most redundacy due to fds
    2. keyy all the original functional dependencies
